WSO2 Observability Solution has now been deployed to your cluster. Under default install you can access Prometheus and Grafana UIs. 
For that please refer above notes. If you can't observe notes above please make sure that you have added 
'--render-subchart-notes' parameter when invoking Helm install command.
Ex: helm install wso2-observability . --render-subchart-notes

If you enable Jaeger section you can also access Jaeger UI. URL will be shown above.

If you enable loki stack, please note that widgets which use Loki datasources must be manually configured to correct datasource due to a limitation
in current Grafana Helm charts. Once you install the chart log widgets will have their datasource set to Promethues.
Please manually change them into loki datasource which is added by the chart.
